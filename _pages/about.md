My name is Yudi Xie, and I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in [Prof. James DiCarlo's lab](http://dicarlolab.mit.edu/) in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Before embarking on this journey at MIT, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

My main research interest is at the intersection of computational neuroscience, cognitive science, and machine learning. Through the lens of machine learning, I utilize deep learning and probabilistic models to develop a computational framework for understanding the intricacies of the brain and mind. These computational models are then tested against empirical behavioral and neural data.

During my undergraduate years, I had the exceptional opportunity to do research in [Prof. Naoshige Uchida's lab](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/uchidalab/home) at Harvard University. There, I used computational tools to investigate the influence of dopamine on novelty-seeking behaviors in mice. My interest in computational neuroscience research was initially sparked through my experience in [Prof. Quan Wen's lab](http://www.wenlab.org/) at USTC, where I investigated the movement decisions of C. elegans.
