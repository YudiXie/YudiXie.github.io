  abstract={Studies of the functional role of the primate ventral visual stream have traditionally focused on object 
  categorization, often ignoring -- despite much prior evidence -- its role in estimating "spatial" latents such as 
  object position and pose. Most leading ventral stream models are derived by optimizing networks for object categorization, 
  which seems to imply that the ventral stream is also derived under such an objective. Here, we explore an alternative 
  hypothesis: Might the ventral stream be optimized for estimating spatial latents? And a closely related question: How 
  different -- if at all -- are representations learned from spatial latent estimation compared to categorization? To ask 
  these questions, we leveraged synthetic image datasets generated by a 3D graphic engine and trained convolutional neural 
  networks (CNNs) to estimate different combinations of spatial and category latents. We found that models trained to estimate 
  just a few spatial latents achieve neural alignment scores comparable to those trained on hundreds of categories, and the spatial 
  latent performance of models strongly correlates with their neural alignment. Spatial latent and category-trained models have 
  very similar -- but not identical -- internal representations, especially in their early and middle layers. We provide evidence 
  that this convergence is partly driven by non-target latent variability in the training data, which facilitates the implicit 
  learning of representations of those non-target latents. Taken together, these results suggest that many training objectives, 
  such as spatial latents, can lead to similar models aligned neurally with the ventral stream. Thus, one should not assume that 
  the ventral stream is optimized for object categorization only. As a field, we need to continue to sharpen our measures of 
  comparing models to brains to better understand the functional roles of the ventral stream.},

  abstract={Dopamine signalling modes differ in kinetics and spatial patterns of receptor activation. 
    How these modes contribute to motor function, motivation and learning has long been debated. 
    Here we show that action-potential-induced dopamine release is dispensable for movement initiation 
    but supports reward-oriented behaviour. We generated mice with dopamine-neuron-specific knockout of 
    the release site organizer protein RIM to disrupt action-potential-induced dopamine release. In these 
    mice, rapid in vivo dopamine dynamics were strongly impaired, but baseline dopamine persisted and fully 
    supported spontaneous movement. Conversely, reserpine-mediated dopamine depletion or blockade of dopamine 
    receptors disrupted movement initiation. The dopamine precursor l-DOPA reversed reserpine-induced bradykinesia 
    without restoring fast dopamine dynamics, a result that substantiated the conclusion that these dynamics are 
    dispensable for movement initiation. In contrast to spontaneous movement, reward-oriented behaviour was impaired 
    in dopamine-neuron-specific RIM knockout mice. In conditioned place preference and two-odour discrimination tasks, 
    the mice effectively learned to distinguish the cues, which indicates that reward-based learning persists after 
    RIM ablation. However, the performance vigour was reduced. During probabilistic cue-reward association, 
    dopamine dynamics and conditioned responses assessed through anticipatory licking were disrupted. These results 
    demonstrate that action-potential-induced dopamine release is dispensable for motor function and subsecond precision of 
    movement initiation but promotes motivation and performance during reward-guided behaviours.},

  abstract={Image-computable modeling of primate ventral stream visual processing has made great strides via brain-mapped 
    versions of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that are optimized on thousands of object categories (ImageNet), the performance 
    of which strongly predicts CNNs' neural alignment. However, human and primate visual intelligence extends far beyond object categorization, 
    encompassing a diverse range of tasks, such as estimating the latent variables of object position or pose in the image. 
    The influence of task choice on neural alignment in CNNs, compared to CNN architecture, remains underexplored, partly due to the scarcity of 
    large-scale datasets with rich known labels beyond categories. 3D graphic engines, capable of creating training images with detailed 
    information on various latent variables, offer a solution. Here, we asked how the choice of visual tasks that are used to train CNNs 
    (i.e., the set of latent variables to be estimated) affects their ventral stream neural alignment. We focused on the estimation of variables 
    such as object position and pose, and we tested CNNs' neural alignment via the Brain-Score open science platform. We found some of these CNNs 
    had neural alignment scores that were very close to those trained on ImageNet, even though their entire training experience has been on synthetic 
    images. Additionally, we found training models on just a handful of latent variables achieved the same level of neural alignment as models 
    trained on a much larger number of categories, suggesting that latent variable training is more efficient than category training in driving 
    model-neural alignment. Moreover, we found that these models' neural alignment scores scale with the amount of synthetic data used during 
    training, suggesting the potential of obtaining more aligned models with larger synthetic datasets. This study highlights the effectiveness of 
    using synthetic datasets and latent variables in advancing image-computable models of the ventral visual stream.},

  abstract={The limited capacity of the brain to retain information in working memory has been well-known and studied for decades, yet the 
    root of this limitation remains unclear. Here we built sensory-cognitive neural network models of working memory that perform tasks using 
    raw visual stimuli. Contrary to intuitions that working memory capacity limitation stems from memory or cognitive constraints, we found that 
    pre-training the sensory region of our models with natural images imposes sufficient constraints on models to exhibit a wide range of human-like 
    behaviors in visual working memory tasks designed to probe capacity. Examining the neural mechanisms in our model reveals that capacity 
    limitation mainly arises in a bottom-up manner. Our models offer a principled and functionally grounded explanation for the working memory 
    capacity limitation without parameter fitting to behavioral data or much hyperparameter tuning. This work highlights the importance of 
    developing models with realistic sensory processing even when investigating memory and other high-level cognitive phenomena.},

  abstract={Working memory (WM) enables humans and other animals to hold information temporarily for various kinds of mental processing. 
    WM has limited capacity and the maintenance of information in WM involves interactions between multiple brain regions. To account for such 
    properties, we built multi-system models of WM, i.e., models that involve both sensory and cognitive systems, and their interactions. Our 
    contributions are twofold, involving engineering and science. Engineering-wise, we built a framework to systematically construct such models 
    to generate and test hypotheses in neuroscience research. Our models take sensory stimuli in their raw form, and reproduce diverse behavioral 
    and neural findings across classical and recent WM experiments. Science-wise, our framework allows us to dissect the sensory and cognitive 
    system's contribution to WM capacity limitation. Our models reproduced behavioral findings in several WM tasks commonly used to assess capacity 
    limitation. We found human-like capacity limitations arise in models with sensory systems pre-trained to recognize natural images, but not in 
    models trained end-to-end on WM tasks. Our results suggest that WM capacity limitation is partly attributed to the sensory system when it is 
    optimized for naturalistic objectives other than tasks artificially designed to probe WM.},

  abstract={Animals both explore and avoid novel objects in the environment, but the neural mechanisms that underlie these behaviors and their 
    dynamics remain uncharacterized. Here, we used multi-point tracking (DeepLabCut) and behavioral segmentation (MoSeq) to characterize the 
    behavior of mice freely interacting with a novel object. Novelty elicits a characteristic sequence of behavior, starting with investigatory 
    approach and culminating in object engagement or avoidance. Dopamine in the tail of the striatum (TS) suppresses engagement, and dopamine 
    responses were predictive of individual variability in behavior. Behavioral dynamics and individual variability are explained by a 
    reinforcement-learning (RL) model of threat prediction in which behavior arises from a novelty-induced initial threat prediction 
    (akin to “shaping bonus”) and a threat prediction that is learned through dopamine-mediated threat prediction errors. These results uncover 
    an algorithmic similarity between reward- and threat-related dopamine sub-systems.},

    the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to study how a nervous system dynamically explores the action space. The initiation of the escape 
    responses is predictable: the animal moves away from a potential threat, a mechanical or thermal stimulus. But the motor sequence and the 
    timing that follow are variable. We report that a feedforward excitation between neurons encoding distinct motor states underlies robust 
    motor sequence generation, while mutual inhibition between these neurons controls the flexibility of timing in a motor sequence. Electrical 
    synapses contribute to feedforward coupling whereas glutamatergic synapses contribute to inhibition. We conclude that C. elegans generates 
    robust and flexible motor sequences by combining an excitatory coupling and a winner-take-all operation via mutual inhibition between motor 
    modules.},
